<br> Caged: An Analysis of Incarceration in Furi
I will be examining the themes related to incarceration, mental health and freedom in the game Furi (2016) by developer The Game Bakers. I will apply frameworks provided by Martin Buber, Jean Paul Sartre,
and Mugambi Jouet, of the philosphy of dialogue, existentionalism and the prison industrial complex, respectively. Through these perspectives I will explore how the game developers implemented said concepts
into the narrative and gameplay of the action game Furi.
