  Caged: An Analysis of Incarceration in Furi
I will be examining the themes related to incarceration, mental health and freedom in the game Furi (2016) by developer The Game Bakers. I will apply frameworks provided by Martin Buber, Jean Paul Sartre,
and Mugambi Jouet, of the philosphy of dialogue, existentionalism and the prison industrial complex, respectively. Through these perspectives I will explore how the game developers implemented said concepts
into the narrative and gameplay of the action game Furi. :</br></p>
 
Narrative-
You play as "The Stranger", a man who has been imprisoned for an indetermined amount of time, and for an unknown cause. The game
begins with first person perspective scene where a jailer in a 3 headed mask vows to infinitely punish you, stating " I will kill
you again and again. I am your future: an eternity of slow, painful deaths". Waking from your unconscious, you hear a disembodied 
voice urging you to "Pull yourself together. Get out of prison. Kill the jailer. Fight for your freedom. The jailer is the key,
Kill him and you'll be free".
