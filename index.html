 <center> Caged: An Analysis of Incarceration in Furi
I will be examining the themes related to incarceration, mental health and freedom in the game Furi (2016) by developer The Game Bakers. I will apply frameworks provided by Martin Buber, 
Jaques Lacan, and Brian Massumi, on the philosphy of dialogue, existentionalism, the prison industrial complex and the affect response. Through these perspectives I will explore how the game 
developers implemented said concepts into the narrative and gameplay of the action game Furi. :</br></p> </center>

You play as "The Stranger", a man who has been imprisoned for an indetermined amount of time, and for an unknown cause. The game
begins with first person perspective scene where a jailer in a 3 headed mask vows to infinitely punish you, stating " I will kill
you again and again. I am your future: an eternity of slow, painful deaths". Waking from your unconscious, you hear a disembodied 
voice urging you to "Pull yourself together. Get out of prison. Kill the jailer. Fight for your freedom. The jailer is the key,
Kill him and you'll be free".

 Psyche-
 In this scene we can assume that the rabbit character is likely a manifestation of the Stranger's subconscious as it refers to "We" while the Stranger does not speak or respond.Taking a closer look at the 
 character reveals that it's movements in the games cutscenes are unnatural, it travels via teleportation and hovers over surfaces and repeatedly appears in locations inaccessible to the player. The Voice 
 wields a microphone stand yet seems to speak only to the Stranger and directly to the player, he also does not appear on screen with any other character simultaneously. I believe this character represents the 
 broken psyche of the Stranger as a result of incarceration, this manifestation works to justify the Stranger's motivationto murder his way out of prison. I could not help but draw parallels to other fictional 
 rabbit figures in the films like "Harvey" (1950, Dir. Henry Koster) and Frank "Donnie Darko (2001, Dir. Richard Kelly) that guided the protagonists through their narratives. I find it interesing that
 the progression of these rabbit characters has lead to more anthropomorphic traits; Harvey the rabbit did not speak, Frank the Rabbitprimarily disguised himself in a rabbit suit and finally the Voice only wears 
 an oversized partial mask. I believe the juxtaposition between a comically large rabbit head only partially obscuring the human within,represents the duality of the "good/bad" internal voice used in media. The 
 rabbit representing innoncence and while the human within urges the player to kill.

 Another character that speaks to the relationship between mental health and incarceration is the second boss fight known as "The Strap". As we approach a spherical prison, the player learns from the Voice that the 
 Strap lives in a "Clever prison within a prison". The Strap character first appears bound with arms behind her back, feet fixed to a motorized wheel and a metal contraption completely encasing her head. Though she 
 is capable of freeing her arms and legs as the battle progresses, she is never able to free her head.  I believe this character is supposed to be a stand in for the practice of solitary confinementand the stigmatization 
 of mental illness within the prison system The connections between this character's straight jacket design and mental illness becomes clear as the Voice 
 tells the player " She was so wild they didn't know what to do with her, so they put her in a cage. They built up the walls to keep her in and so you couldn't hear her screaming"

  Gameplay-
  On the surface, Furi's biggest draw is likely it's visual aesthetic and soundtrack. The vibrant assault colors typical of "bullet hell" games, along with intense, heavy yet catchy electronic music keep the player 
  in a sense of constant stimulation and tension. I believe this resulting tension can trigger what is known as the "flow state"(Csikszentmihalyi,1990) as a positive outcome or anxiety as a negative outcome, both
  of which can be described as the Brian Massumi's affect response. Affect being the bodie's response prior to the interpretive phase of assigning and expressing emotion.

  Below the surface however, the developers also appeal to the emotional response within extremely slow sequences between battles. I believe that the mechanic of slowly traversing between levels forces the player
  to digest the cryptic narrative and foregrounds the music. This slow passage of time as the protagonist dawdles fits the previously discussed themes of the solitude and pondering that comes with imprisonment. By giving
  the player limited control, the game encourages the player to contemplate the narrative being told by The Voice. It is here when one starts to wonder the reliablity of the narrator since The Voice progressively becomes
  more emotionally expressive of anger. I believe that the distinction between The Stranger and The Voice can be summed up through Lacan's mirror. The Stranger has become the "ideal I" or ego from the isolation of inprisonment,
  lacks the gestalt and manifested the Imago in The Voice as a defense mechanism.
